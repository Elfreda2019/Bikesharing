# Bikesharing

## Overview
The main objective of this challenge is to show or demonstrate to investors the most
important relevant data/information required to support the Des Moines bike-sharing
business, using New York bike sharing data in the month of August 2019.

## Results

There were 2,344,224 rides in the city of New York, a new variable check-up times was
created. The results are presented as follows:

Checkout times for users (riders)

Using line charts, from Figure 1, we observe a right skewed distribution of trip duration
(number of riders per minutes) with the most trips completed within five (5) minutes
(short duration). There are fewer trips completed after an hour to two hours.

Checkout times for users (riders) by gender

Using line charts, from Figure 2, we observe that most male riders completed the trips
within five (5) minutes followed by their female counterparts. There are more female
riders who completed their trips after an hour to two hours.

Trips by Weekday per hour

Using heat map: from Figure 3, we observe that most trips starts at 5pm and 6pm on
Thursdays with Mondays to Tuesdays showing some similar pattern of trips at 8am. It is
observed that quite substantial number of trips starts from 8am on Mondays to
Thursdays. The volume of trips goes down on all other times and days of the week.

Bike Repairs

The average trips per bike was calculated as the ratio of number of trips by number of
unique bikes. The average trips per bike =2,344,224/13,983 = 167.6 trips per bike. We
calculate 3 standard deviations away from the average of 167.6 and filtered bike Idâ€™s
with trips greater than 400. Statistically those bikes are unusual and would require major
maintenance. From Figure 7, we observe that about 70 of those bikes needs repairs.

Bike-sharing business is a convenient, environmentally friendly way to get around the
New York City at low cost. In the data, it was revealed that the top starting locations are
similar to the top ending locations. Overall, most tourist riders subscribes to the bike-
sharing business and completes their trips within 5 minutes. Most male tourist riders
that subscribes to the business have shorter trip duration compared to the females and
the other unknowns. The peak starting times of the week are from 5pm and 6pm on
Thursdays. The results also showed that at 8am on Mondays and Tuesdays, most
tourists riders start riding in the city, with low rides during the weekends. We captured
bikes that needs repairs in spite of high utilization. In summary, we have shown three
aspects of relevant data in bike-sharing business namely commuting patterns, demand
patterns and usage information. The top starting locations were similar to the top
stopping location, thus commuting patterns are similar. The analysis revealed that with
the demand pattern, we can forecast demands at peak riding hours, how many bikes
would be needed? Most significantly, 5pm and 6pm on Thursdays, Mondays and
Tuesdays. The usage information would help business operators make accurate
determination about whether they need to fix a broken bike. Customer experience
comes with benefits of being a subscriber since the shorter the duration the less one
pays.
